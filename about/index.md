Hi, I'm **Kaushik Nishtala**, a data scientist with a diverse range of interests:

- Avid reader
- Love to travel
- Enjoy music, art, and wildlife photography
- Passionate about playing games
- Enthusiastic about AI Research, technological trends and gadgets
- Follow Tennis, cricket, and basketball closely
- Play the piano during both my highs and lows

While these personal interests give a glimpse into who I am, professionally, I am driven by deep work, connecting with others, and learning something new every day. I'm fascinated by the evolving economic landscape and the massive amount of data that continues to grow at an extraordinary rate. I channel my passion into analyzing numbers, statistics, and visualizing data. Anything that involves math, data, logic, and reason captures my interest immediately. *I am captivated by the process of transforming meaningful data into numbers, numbers into words, words into stories, and stories into actions to make a difference.*

This is my first professional blog, where I aim to share interesting insights about my work in AI - machine learning, algorithms, statistics, mathematical modeling, and emerging topics in AI and its applications. It's a way to document things I find interesting for my future self. While I tend to be concise, I aim to keep my posts focused and precise, elaborating on the points that require emphasis and always striving to proofread carefully.

I’m best reached via email and linkedin. I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
