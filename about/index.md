Hi peeps!
This is **Kaushik** and well, to put it short I'd like to call myself a math geek. But when you get right down to it, I'm much more:
- an avid reader
- **love** to travel
- enjoy a fair amount of music, art and wildlife photography
- love playing games
- geek out over technological trends and gadgets
- tend to keep up with Tennis, cricket and Basketball
- also play piano in my highs and lows.

Assuming this should suffice to cover up my personal interests, professionally I'm into deep work, connecting with people, and constantly learning something new everyday.
I am intrigued by the changing economic landscape and sheer amount of data that's been growing at an exorbitant pace over the years and those to follow.
I basically channel my interests and vision down into crunching numbers, stats and visualizing data, so anything that deals with math and data with an appreciable flavor of logic and reason will hook me up on it right away. *I'm fascinated by the idea of capturing and transforming conspicuous and meaningful data into numbers, numbers into words, words into stories and stories into action to make this a reality for everyone.*

Participation in affiliate marketing of products from Amazon under an influencer program led to my foray into Data science. The lackluster marketing of products for months on end enfeebled my enthusiasm into realms of monotony. Thanks to my curiosity, I rifled through many Data Science articles on *medium.com* that changed my perspective on viewing and confronting the data around us. And as is the case with self-fulfilling prophecies, having to deal with rigours of venturing into data science proved challenging, one rife with lots of learning in the form of *MOOCs*, *hackathons* and *workshops* yet at the same time whetted my curiosity and carved a path to solving more complex problems and paved way to glean corporate exposure.

My ultimate intent of pursuit in **research** is to build useful systems and algorithms that derive meaning, learn patterns, produce insights and predictions from diverse data for various applications. I believe it to be one of the fastest ways to make the world advance. The experience gained thus far helped me identify the need for advancements of real time business intelligence and decision making in supply chain analytics, healthcare & BFSI, etc. In order to seamlessly integrate these areas, a new architecture needs to be developed which calls for comprehensive research in this regard.

This is my first professional blog. I want to utilize this space to write about my work, about machine learning, algorithms, statistics,  mathematical modeling, emerging topics in data science and its applications hoping it would become an outlet for technical, intuitive and programming-related posts. It's my way to document things I find interesting for my future self.
Although I'm one of those laconic types, I intend to keep everything I want to share regarding my professional landscape and interests crisp and precise, elaborating on the pointers that require more emphasis while trying my best to proofread my own posts.

In a nutshell, my *passion* for content is coupled with a love for big picture planning, daily data trends and analysis along with a hint of contributing to productive research in the desired fields. I'm not the one who just wants to work. I'm the one who actually wants to **work**-and **plan**, **ideate**, and **lead**. This is what I drive my passion towards and strive to do best and love most.
