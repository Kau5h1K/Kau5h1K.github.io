excerpt: "In the part 2 of this project, I plan to train a classifier to identify type of a particle among electron, proton, muon, kaon, pion and ghost. Ghost is a particle with other type than the first five or a detector noise. Different particle types remain different responses in the detector systems or subdetectors such as tracking system, ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH), electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and muon system. The aim is to identify a particle type using the responses in the detector systems."
