title: "Sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews using RNNs [Pytorch]"
tags: [ Project ]
date: 2019-10-31
excerpt: "I seek to build a model that can read in some text and make a prediction about the sentiment of that text, where it is positive or negative by training the model on a dataset of movie reviews from IMDB that have been labeled either \"positive\" or \"negative\". Since this is text data, words in a sequence, I wish to use an RNN to build a model that doesn't only consider the individual words, but the order they appear in."
