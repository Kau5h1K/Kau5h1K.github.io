excerpt: "I have actively participated with a team of three in the HEALTH DATATHON project funded by the State Government, which focused on the prevalent issue of Low haemoglobin levels (<10% mg/dl) faced by people, estimated to be about 14.3% of the target population. By running statistical estimation procedures on the lab data, revamping status review and reporting of stakeholders, facilitating Continuum of Digital tracking by managing digital health records and by remodeling strategies to cluster and associate healthcare facilities to prone areas, we have achieved  a National and International standards (12.5 mg/dl) in decreasing the overall haemoglobin levels to <5% of target population."
