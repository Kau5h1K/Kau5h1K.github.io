excerpt: "Facial composites are widely used in forensics to generate images of suspects. Since victim or witness usually isn't good at drawing, computer-aided generation is applied to reconstruct the face attacker. One of the most commonly used techniques are evolutionary systems that compose the final face from many predefined parts.

In this project I wish to try to implement an app for creating facial composite that will be able to construct desired faces without explicitly providing databases of templates. I aim to apply Variational Autoencoders and Gaussian processes for this task."
