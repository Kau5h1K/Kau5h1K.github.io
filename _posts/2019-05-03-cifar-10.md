excerpt: "This project aims to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. I begin with preprocessing the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded and then build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, you'll get to see my neural network's predictions on the sample images."
