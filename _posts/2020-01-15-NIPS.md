title: "Classifying the effect of Genetic mutations to enable Personalized Medicine"
tags: [ Passion Project, Project]
date: 2020-01-15
excerpt: "Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). Using this knowledge base as a baseline, I seek to develop a machine learning model that automatically classifies genetic variations."
