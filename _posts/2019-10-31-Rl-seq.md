tags: [ Project ]
date: 2019-10-31
excerpt: "This time, I plan to solve a problem of transribing hebrew words in english, also known as g2p (grapheme2phoneme) word (sequence of letters in source language) -> translation (sequence of letters in target language).
Unlike most deep learning researchers do, I won't only train it to maximize likelihood of correct translation, but also employ reinforcement learning to actually teach it to translate with as few errors as possible."
