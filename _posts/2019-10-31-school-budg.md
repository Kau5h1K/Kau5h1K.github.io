title: "[Case Study] School Budgets Automation"
tags: [ Case Study ]
date: 2019-10-31
excerpt: "Data science isn't just for predicting ad-clicks-it's also useful for social impact! This post is a case study from a machine learning competition on DrivenData. I aim to explore a problem related to school district budgeting. By building a model to automatically classify items in a school's budget, it makes it easier and faster for schools to compare their spending with other schools. I'll begin by building a baseline model that is a simple, first-pass approach by processing budget data using NLP and then gradually improve upon the performance of the model using winner tactics."
