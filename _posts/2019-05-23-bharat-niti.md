excerpt: "When I interned at a Governmental organization, I have developed valuable insights and correlations between literacy and growth rates in the different regions of state in order to produce visualizations on 2018 state election results to assess reasons for political party victories in specific regions, to identify distinguished and unique reasons for the presence of outliers in the election database, reporting status of political parties and votes distribution, composition/allocation of seats in the assembly, women participation and expenditure incurred in Election using Tableau."
